==Vario settings==

A *[https://code.google.com/p/openxvario/wiki/BuildInstructions MS5611 barometric sensor]* can be connected to OXS and provide altitude and vertical speed data.

Sensitivity can be set between:
  * 20 (conservative setting, reaction time = several seconds)
  * 150 (fast but lot of errors, reaction time = much less than a second)
  
50 is a standard setting when measuring small vertical speed (search for lift with a glider).

- Sensitivity Min. = sensitivity value being used when vertical speed is lower than Vertical speed sensibility Min. (Standard value = 40)

- Sensitivity Max. = sensitivity value being used when vertical speed is higher than Vertical speed sensibility Max. (Standard value = 100)

Sensitivity Max. can be set equal to Min. when higher sensitivity for high vertical speed is unwanted.

- Vertical speed sensibility Min. (cm/s) --> Sensitivity Min. applies when vertical speed is lower than this value. (Standard value = 20)

- Vertical speed sensibility Max. (cm/s) --> Sensitivity Max. applies when vertical speed is higher than this value. (Standard value = 100)

Sensitivity is automatically interpolated between Vertical speed sensibility Min. ans Vertical speed sensibility Max.

If the checkbox RC remote sensitivity is ticked, sensitivity can also be adjusted from the Tx using a switch and/or a potentiometer and a servo channel.

In this case, a receiver signal servo pin has to be connected to the arduino pin chosen in the PPM Pin drop down list.

- PPM range Min. = the minimum value of the ppm input (pulse length in microseconds ). (Standard OpenTX value is 988)

- PPM range Max. = the maximum value of the ppm input (pulse length in microseconds ). (Standard OpenTX value is 2012)

The PPM sensitivity parameters define the range in which you will be able to adjust the sensitivity value.

- PPM sensitivity Min. = the sensitivity minimum value. (Standard value could be 20)

- PPM sensitivity Max. = the sensitivity maximum value. (Standard value could be 100)

_Note : When Arduino detects a signal from TX, the parameters for the predefined sensitivity are automatically discarded._

OXS can also apply some hysteresis on vertical speed changes.

This parameter allows to avoid that transmitted vertical speed changes too often (which can result in bad sound alerts).

It means that transmitted vertical speed will change only if measured vertical speed (after filtering) differs from previous transmitted value by more than the Hysteresis value. (Standard value can be 5 (5 cm/s), 0 means no hysteresis)

OXS can also deliver the vertical speed as an analog signal that has to be connected to A1 or A2 on D series receivers.

This can be useful if you have a receiver that has no digital communication pin (D6FR) or if it is already used by another sensor.

*! Additional Hardware is required !*     --     Please read [https://code.google.com/p/openxvario/wiki/AnalogClimbRate Analog Climb Rate].

To activate this feature, tick the Analog climb rate checkbox and choose the Climb rate Pin in the drop down list.

Then set the Min. and Max. Climb rate values (m/s) that you want to output to the receiver.

- Climb rate Min. value or lower will apply 0 V to the receiver analog pin (A1 or A2).

- Climb rate Max.  value or higher will apply 3.2 V to the receiver analog pin (A1 or A2).
